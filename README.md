This report explores the data from a longitudinal study on MRI results of patients with/without dementia. The analysis is guided by the research questions formulated as a result of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The datasets include cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI data from young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults.

Based on the EDA, the first research question is: what is the effect of cognitive status and initial or subsequent visits on MMSE scores among individuals aged 60 and above? The mixed-method ANOVA has been employed to answer the research question. 

The next research question is: what is the impact of age group and initial or subsequent visit on eTIV among individuals aged 60 and above? The mixed method ANOVA has been employed in this instance as well.
